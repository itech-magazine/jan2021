Dear Readers,
==============

In the year 2020, Human civilization faced unforeseen situations like the COVID-19 crisis, the Locust attack, and unprecedented country-wide lockdowns across the world. Thankfully the worst is over and the entire world is welcoming the year 2021 with new zeal, excitement, and vision. This year would definitely come as a year of healing, recovery, and resurgence. It will certainly rescript the growth narrative which was disrupted by events of the year 2020. One of the key elements of this rescripting would be Technology.  

Honorable PM in the recent Bengaluru Tech Summit 2020  underlined the importance of technology. He remarked that, **“We are in the middle of the information era. The future is coming sooner than anticipated. In the information era, the first mover did not matter; the best mover did, and anyone can make a product any time that disrupts all existing equations of the market”**.  *One such disruptive 21st-century solution is the Faceless assessment system launched by the Department of Income Tax*.  The acceptance of this innovative solution in the field is encouraging and reassuring. Directorate of Income Tax(Systems) is leaving no stone unturned in tapping the latest technologies in making our department more tech-savvy, futuristic, and world-class.  

The fourth edition of our quarterly magazine **i-Tech** aims to provide a flash-view of the kind of technologies and problems which the Directorate of Income Tax(Systems) solves behind the curtains.  As with the previous versions, this edition also contains a mix of articles ranging from Data sciences, Information Security, API based architecture, Network, Design, Datacenter, and Quantum cryptography. In addition to the above, this edition of the magazine marks a significant milestone in our short journey. With this edition, we have decided to switch to a **website-based model** for publishing articles. This makes our content easy to share, catalog, reference, and manage. The change from a PDF-based publishing model to an Online model will also help us in shifting to an anytime publishing mode and provide us a bigger platform for participating in the technology and related  discussions.  

We hope the content of this magazine will help in bridging the gap between Systems and other limbs of the department and would provide more acceptance and space to systems in creating a department of the 21st century.
