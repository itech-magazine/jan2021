TECHONOMY
=======================

In the 21st century, India has emerged as an attractive destination for business and economic opportunities. Its economic prowess standing on the bedrock of 3 D’s demography, democracy, and demand has proved to be a force multiplier.  With the Digital India initiative becoming a way of life, the Indian economy is set to become more inclusive and resilient.  

Recently, wiki brands released a list of top 10 technologies that could drive growth, development, and inclusion in the next decade (Refer Fig). The list contained buzzwords like Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, IOT, etc. However, it would be interesting to see if a list tailored for the western world would be applicable to the Indian setup or not. The use-cases and developmental priorities may differ for India. The same digital technology which is used for solving the problem of shortage of manpower needs to be used in a manner such that more human jobs are generated in India. In this backdrop, we are listing the common use cases where these technologies could be deployed to create a new landscape in India.

>1. Sanitation technology  

India has a huge scope for sanitation technology research. Just imagine a smart dustbin where you dump your waste and obtain a credit for free wi-fi or a Just-in-time waste pickup and processing pipeline. Or imagine small scale waste processing machines installed in the backyard which can generate energy and extract metal/minerals.

>2. Artificial Intelligence  

A real-time face recognition enabled services or image matching based services can play a phenomenal role in regulating traffic, crowd control, and bringing discipline in public life. AI/ML-based governance framework would be more judicious and scientific in resource allocation.

>3. Public audit systems  

24*7 live real-time monitoring of public offices and public projects can help in keeping watch over performance of public offices and set vigil over the progress of public projects. The online detailing of account expenses through user-friendly interfaces, mobile apps can make the whole of India participate in the entire process.   

>4.	Green technologies  

Cheap solutions to Solar panels, smart metering, water harvesting system, piped gas line, piped waterline (clean water tech), energy-efficient housing technology, rooftop/backyard landscape design using tree plantation, Electric vehicle, efficient public transport system is the need of the hour for our nation.

>5.	Mobility based digital solutions  

School, Dispensary, Public offices, Post offices, Courts, Police Stations, Toilets, Cinemaghars, Election booths, etc. could be installed on customized mobile vehicles like cars, buses, Trucks rather than brick and mortar solutions. The mobile office could be taken to the doorsteps of the common man rather than common man searching for them.


All of this is possible with the correct application of economy and technology. Faceless Income Tax is an illustrious example of synergy between Technology and the Economy. With the availability of talent, technology, and team spirit, India is well poised to achieve all the vision of New India.
