Quantum Cryptography - The science of exploiting quantum mechanical properties to perform cryptographic tasks
======================================

It's easy to multiply two prime numbers, but it's difficult, given a large number, to find its two prime factors. 
This fundamental idea acts as the basis for asymmetric key algorithms like RSA. Such algorithms are based on the mathematical difficulty of factorisation or lack of knowledge of 
some algorithm that can accomplish the same in a reasonable amount of time.  RSA is used pervasively in all our internet activities like browsing, emails, digital signature etc. 
Therefore, a lot is at stake when such an algorithm goes friable. And, of course, yes, as the time progress, technologies are developing that threaten existing algorithms and test their mettle. Such technologies can lay bare open all our communications, rendering the existing algorithms--virtually useless.


It has already been established that Quantum computers can easily crack RSA, provided one can develop Quantum computers with enough qubits for doing so. 
Qubits give us the total number of states a Quantum computer can be at a time. With a qubit size of 64, a quantum computer can work concurrently using 2<sup>64</sup> states, 
and to solve an equivalent problem, a supercomputer may take months. Currently, research is progressing on developing Quantum computers with an increased number of qubits. 
At the same time, science has been resilient by developing new technologies that counteract such challenges, time and again. In this direction came Quantum Cryptography, 
which is theoretically, uncrackable. 


Quantum cryptography is a potential antidote to the existing challenge posed by Quantum computers. The fundamental idea behind quantum cryptography lies on the fact that two quantum particles can ideally mimic each other state, even from a distance, without having any 
interaction between themâ€”called as quantum entanglement. That is if we send one particle to one person and the second particle to another, it is guaranteed that when both 
receive them, each particle will be in the same state as that of the other. The state of the particle can be a random 0 or 1, but this is good enough for exchanging a 
random cryptographic asymmetric key between the two interested parties. Any snooping, while on transit, can change the state of the particles and thus they are detectable.

Does it have any challenges ?
-------------------
Like any other technology, some security challenges go beyond the physics of quantum mechanics. It comes in the form of intermediate repeaters that can be a bottleneck 
in establishing a secure communication channel between two entities. And on a large scale, there will be a requirement for using routers and hubs that are all weak points 
in the communication chain.


Quantum mechanics is the basis for Quantum Cryptography and Quantum Computer and the research related to the same is still a work in progress. Currently, the latest known 
quantum computer is having a maximum of 65 qubits in length, and there is a long way to go before entering the quantum realm of thousands of qubits. Over time, some 
difficulties due to the inconsistency in measuring quantum states, and issues of noise while measuring them have caused underutilisation of all the available qubits. 
Countries like China have made strides in the research of such bleeding-edge technologies, and also has an experimental satellite to test quantum technology. 

> India has recently ventured on to Quantum Computing research with an allotment of Rs. 8000 crores in the budget.

Conclusion
-------------------
Certainly, Quantum technology is going to be a disruptive technology with profound impacts on all walks of life. It is time to rethink how today's computation will work tomorrow, and there are a lot of leeways for the bright minds to invest in, and invent, some of the pathbreaking technologies, and become trailblazers in the arena of Quantum Computing.
