Leadership Talents
==========================

The right leadership is an asset to any organisation -  talent that can propel strategic change and catalyse organisations towards ambitious and common goals. 
Leaders should have the power to transform vision into reality; bring focus and commitment along with execution, thereby driving incremental changes to exponential ones. 
Such leaders help build and sustain a high-performance culture;  take proactive steps helping the organization to thrive even under the most adverse environment. 

Any organization is a conglomeration of people from diverse background, experience, beliefs, working towards a common goal. And the employees look up to their leaders as the ones who strive to do the right things -  creating a conducive workplace, provide equal opportunities for performance and growth, ensure psychological safety among others.
Leadership has many facets. A part essence is captured in the quote  below :
  
> Management is doing things right while leadership is doing the right things. – Peter Drucker

Though assuming a leadership role in an organisation in itself is an accomplishment, the real triumph lies in building and maintaining a highly-effective team. 
Sadly, often, the biggest blunders are caused by the silliest mistakes, by the most competent leaders resulting in resentment among employees and co-workers.
  
Most leaders develop that unbreakable faith in their intelligence, instincts and abilities.  Overconfidence in leadership can prove detrimental to organisational growth as they seldom allow the opinions of others to influence their decision-making process. Leaders must be real go-getters, take risks, but they must personify 
humility and unarguably prove they are  most "qualified for the job" through  relentless efforts  

Lack of delegation and micromanagement at the leadership level, not only affects the morale of co-workers but also hampers growth and stunts productivity. Thus many high performing leaders end up with de-motivated teams.  

> Theodore Roosevelt once said, “The best leader  is one who has sense enough to pick good men to do what he wants to be done, and self-restraint enough to keep from meddling with them while they do it.”.
  
It's crucial to  “walk the talk”.  How does a leader ensure this?   A leader must always align his personal code of ethics with the organisation's core values. 
Idealistic values demonstrated by trustworthy leaders are proven to provide companies with a viable competitive advantage. Leaders must be the change they want to see in their company. Actions must follow words and promises. Aligning them all is part of living with integrity.

Feedback is a powerful tool that provides real results and boosts strong employee engagement. Keeping team members motivated is a Herculean task for some leaders. Giving and receiving constructive feedback on a regular basis can motivate employees. Motivated employees are not only more productive, but they are also happier and more engaged. 
  
Pragmatism and strong performers are two sides of the same coin. These leaders tend to set the bar high, and they push the employees too hard to achieve unrealistic goals.
Leaders must essentially be adaptive based on situations. A leader never wants to stop excelling. But in doing so he should make sure that his employees are not cracking under pressure. If so, he may want to  dial down on the toughness, and focus on delivering more ‘constructive’ and less ‘criticism.’
  
Eventually, a smart leader will become a good leader once he does something very counter-intuitive: surrender control. Good leaders are those who foster high trust, high risk-taking, and high creativity because they take the higher road of sharing their power and releasing their control over people.
