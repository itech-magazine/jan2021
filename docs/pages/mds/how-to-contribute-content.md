Hello folks,

Thank you for thinking to contribute for i-Tech Magazine. We have made things easy for you. Now you do not need to take pains to submit your article via Google drive or Whatsapp.
Just consider this page as template and start writing your article. This page is written using [Markdown] and is automatically
converted to HTML using [Marked]. Markdown is a simple text format whose goal is to be very easy to read and write.

You must start your markdown file with your name and designation/project in second line, just like I have done here.
And upload your photograph at this [path] with name as `firstname-middlename-lastname.jpg`. You can skip middlename 
if you so desire. The rendering code will create image name your name.

Also, try to keep the first thing after title, as an image, It just looks tad better.

Markdown can have sub-headings too
-------------------

1. Your stuff can be a list
2. Which is very simple and easy to create.

See, That's it. Pretty simple huh!. You want a non-numbered bulleted list ? Well, here is how you can create one.

- **Preview:**  A live display of the generated HTML as it would render in a browser.
- **HTML Source:**  The generated HTML before your browser makes it pretty.
- **Lexer Data:**  What [marked] uses internally, in case you like gory stuff like this.
- **Quick Reference:**  A brief run-down of how to format things using markdown.

And did you notice those leading and trailing stars ? Well those are for making your text bold, just like Whatsapp does while messaging.

Other features
-------------

You can even add a preformatted text mostly used for adding code. It can be done this way

```
x = 2
y = 3
x,y = y,x
```

It's that simple. Well, if you don't know, that is a python code for swapping.
And you know, you can even create tables using Markdown. See just like a table below.

| ColA | ColB | 
|---|---|
Data A1 | DataB
Data A2 | DataB2
Data A3 | DataB3

Awesome right ? Once you start writing in Markdown, you will fall in love with it.


Remember, you must name your file as per the topic in the index. Eg. if you topic is *Machine Learning* name of the file you are submitting content 
in should be `machine-learning.md`. Checkout this file as markdown from [here]. Copy its content to your new file and start editing.
