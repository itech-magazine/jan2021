DONUT - The Mentor

I know it would sound weird on the face of it but I am sure that majority of you would join the league by the time I am through with my prophecy.

Ironically, we relate Animal Instinct to only Beastly Overtures and nothing else, which is rather unfair towards all species other than Homosepians. I also wonder as how we maintain double standards when we equivocally pronounce Dog as the most trustworthy living thing on earth and at the same time in order to demean someone, we compare him with the same Dog. Thus, upto this point, one thing is proved, that no matter how forward or modern the Homosepians have become, they are still a Confused Lot!

I was also misconstruing & misusing the phrase ‘A Dog’s Life’ for over 5 decades till I embraced one, who completed my family by becoming the most loving, lovable and above all, most GENUINE MEMBER of it. 

My 15 month experience with him made me do some self-introspection in terms of estimating human behavior vis-à-vis a Dog’s psyche. And this makes me repeat the title of this article **‘Only if we had PREDOMINANT Animal Instinct...’**.

You may have all kinds of relations at home ranging from being Grandson to Grandfather or being Daughter to Daughter-in-law, but it is as undeniable truth that there would be only one relation which would never get rusted - that of between you and your QUADRUPED Kid. He would be the only member who would never miss bidding you ‘Bye’ and waiting Impatiently to see you back - safe & sound, besides not missing to miss you in between.

We have all been blessed with a loads of vocabularies in many languages, but how do we use them? In finding choicest of words to manipulate & manage own and others’ lives? The tongue is sparingly used to spread sweetness because mostly, it is busy spitting fire. However, our silent friends, although have been blessed with just one word - WOOF, they have an impeccable ability to say it in so many ways that many Websters & Collins may fall short of words before them. What an irony, that we, the so called PRIZED SPECIES OF THE UNIVERSE cannot understand the meaning of an innocent ‘WOOF’ and an Illiterate, Belittled, Maligned quadruped doesn’t misinterpret even a gesture of us, let alone not understanding the language. He has taught the world that Tongue has not been given to Spit Fire and Hurt, but to Heal the Wounds and express one’s Love.

Another self-proclaimed specialty of the human race is ‘Sense & Sensibility’, which too appears to be overrated when it is put beside a Dog’s. Probably we have interpreted Sensibility only in a Reciprocal manner, whereas our counterpart puts in much more sense in all its acts without restricting himself to be only reciprocal. It’s a big myth that animals act in a revengeful manner. Inspite of carrying a much better memory than ours, they don’t preserve junk like vengeance, vices and animosity; unlike us. They make the best forgetful creature on earth, when it comes to follow the saying ‘Let Bygone be Bygone’ without preserving the skeletons in the closet. A dog will caress & moist the same hand, which had hit him a minute ago. On the contrary, a manhood will remain incomplete until a raised hand is amputated, though symbolically. So? Which Sensibility we feel proud of? Inspite of having a better equipped body than a Dog, we err in making the correct decision, whereas for him only Touch & Smell is sufficient to distinguish between friends & foes.

And we still undermine a ‘Dog’s Life’?

Thus, to conclude, the moot point is that; WHO WAS THE FIRST PERSON WHO DWARFED THE STATURE OF THE 4-LEGGED FRATERNITY AND PROCLAIMED HIMSELF ‘THE GREATEST’? I, therefore, reiterate that this would have been a more beautiful & congenial world **‘Only if we had PREDOMINANT Animal Instinct...’**
