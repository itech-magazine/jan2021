>Hello Friends,  
In the previous article we read about various sections involved in Income tax return filing and this is next article in the series which focuses on Assessment and its procedure.

ASSESSMENT
=============
Assessment means ‘action of assessing someone or something’ In terms of return filing It can be Self-Assessment, Summary Assessment, Regular Assessment, Escaped Amount Assessment, Search and reference Assessment.

SECTION 140(A) - SELF ASSESSMENT
---------------------------------
While filing an income tax return under section 139, there are two options to choose return *New tax regime* or *Old tax regime*, Assessee can himself choose the option, if he selects new tax regime then new tax slab rates were applicable and deductions and exemptions were not allowed. If Assessee selects old tax regime then Assessee can determine income tax payable based on his income with his return filing form, by consolidating all sources of income earned and excluding deductions and exemptions if applicable, and then reducing TDS, Advance tax, TCS if paid and then determining the payable tax, file return accordingly this process is Self-Assessment.

SECTION 143(1) - SUMMARY ASSESSMENT
-----------------------------------

After filing return, summary Assessment is carried out digitally without human intervention, according to the acts and rules which were already included in the system. The information submitted by Assessee in the return file will be cross verified against the information which is available with the department by online system. In the process reasonableness and correctness of the return is verified and processed, if any adjustments for arithmetic errors, disallowances and incorrect claims are automatically corrected. After making adjustments, the intimation under section 143(1) will be sent, if Assessee is required to pay tax then he has to comply with the intimation u/s 143(1).

SECTION 143(3) - REGULAR ASSESSMENT / SCRUTINY ASSESSMENT
--------------------------------------------------------
The furnished returns will be selected by the system without human intervention based on certain parameters decided by CBDT, these returns will be thoroughly examined by Income Tax Authority for the genuin and correctness of the information furnished in the return by Assessee to ensure that Assessee has neither understated his income or loss or overstated any expenses or underpaid any tax.  
If any furnished return is selected for scrutiny, the department will send a notice u/s 143(2) well in advance. However such notice cannot be send after the expiry of 6 months from the end of financial year in which return is filed.  
The Assessee will be asked to produce evidences, books of accounts if required to verify and validate the information furnished in the return. After verifying all the details with the information available in the department, the Income Tax Authority passes an order either confirming the return of income filed or making additions this raises an Income Tax Demand, which Assessee must respond to it accordingly.  

SECTION 144 – BEST JUDGEMENT ASSESSMENT
---------------------------------------
Best Judgement assessment will be applicable in the following scenarios:
-If the assessee fails to respond to a notice issued by the department to produce certain information or books of accounts.
-If the assessee fails to comply with a Special Audit ordered by the Income tax authorities.
-If the assessee fails to file the return within due date prescribed in u/s139(1) or such extended time limit as allowed by the CBDT or a belated return u/s 139(4) or a revised return u/s 139(5).
-If the assessee fails to comply with the terms as contained in the notice issued under Summary Assessment.  

After providing an opportunity to hear the Assessee’s argument, the Income tax authority passes an order based on all the relevant materials and evidence available with the department. This process is Best Judgement Assessment.  

SECTION 147 – INCOME ESCAPING ASSESSMENT
----------------------------------------
When Income Tax Authority has sufficient reasons to believe that any taxable income has escaped from taxation to assess, or from earlier assessment to assess the income of assessee’s, Income Tax Authority Initiates Assessment u/s 147. The time limit to issuing a notice to reopen the assessment is 4 years from the end of the relevant assessment year.  
Section 147 is initiated in the following senarios:
-The assessee may be having taxable income but has not yet filed his return.
-The assessee, after filing the income tax return, is found to have either understated his income or claimed excess allowances or deductions.  
The assessee has failed to furnish reports on international transactions, where he is required to do so.


SECTION 153A and SECTION 153C – ASSESSMENT IN CASE OF SEARCH OR REQUISITION and ANY OTHER PERSON
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Based on certain reasonable information Income Tax Department's Investigation wing carries out search or requisition on Assessee’s premises/offices and tries to find out unaccounted or escaped money from taxation i.e. The searched Assessee’s income is assessed under section 153A, while doing the search process if any other information is found which may related to other Assessee’s those will be considered as reference assessment and their income assessed under section 153C.
